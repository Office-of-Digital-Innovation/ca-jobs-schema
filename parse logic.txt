civil parse logic

1. replace .*\n lines to clear all the junk, won't catch the very last line in file
	this is being replaced by automated grep removals

2. if it has a $ sign in it then is a "pay line"
	if first character of pay line is a $ sign then it doesn't have ranges, proceed
		low pay
		-
		high pay
		"HR" if it is hourly (see pg 134), optional

		SISA (opt)
		footnotes (sets of 2 digit numerics, opt, sep by space)
		ar crit (alternate range criteria, sets of 3 digit numerics, opt)
		MCR (modified classification review) almost always a 1 or 0, maybe 2
		space
		6 or 12 for prob months
		space
		WWG (E or 2_, 1 or 2 digits, everyone has one)
		nt (nt or lt, limited term temp intermittent)
		CBID 3 digits, alpha num num


	if the first char of pay line is not a $ then it has ranges, which is always one character followed by a space
		1 range character
		1 space
		1 $
		low pay until -
		1 $
		high pay until space


3. if it's NOT a pay line then it's a title line which is easy
	first 4 is scheme
	one space
	5-8 is class
	one space
	10 to end of line is title

need to be able to import line by line, what do i do that does this? ref. python geocoder

need data frames to store it in, dicts or arrays, lists

start by storing the entire string and classifying whether pay or title line 0/1 bool
