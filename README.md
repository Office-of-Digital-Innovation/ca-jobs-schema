Exploring ALL California Job Classification Schemas

Exploratory project intended to make CalHR job classification data useful in parsed form, enabling sorting and in-depth analysis, cross-referencing and clustering

Currently:
* Uses wget to download the most recent version of the alphabetic jobs classification schema
* Python parsing of all fields using string manipulation and export to txt, csv, etc.

Known Issues:
* Requires consistent, automated way to convert PDF to raw text
 * Have considered xpdf, pdftotxt, ghostscript, all work.. but text recognition formats are inconsistent, even without considering OCR
 * This is still a manual process as of this posting

Future Plans:
* Cluster job classifications by schema, in order to demonstrate promotional opportunities by strict ladder classification
* Provide visual representation of job clusters and potential lateral promotions between distinct ladders
 * Potentially via python scikit-learn or scipy.cluster, GNU gephi
* Integrate schematic arrangement of classes via http://www.calhr.ca.gov/Pay%20Scales%20Library/PS_Sec_16.pdf
